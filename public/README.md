# My Honest Developer Portoflio

On this portfolio website I will represent myself as a developer and a person in general

## In short my current web developer knowledge consists of:

 - Javascript
 - HTML/CSS/SCSS/BootStrap
 - React.js
 - Express.js

## Currently I'm working on:

 - PHP ( to understand backend )
 - Javascript ( OOP programming )
 - As a snack, getting used to Wordpress ( as I wish to work with in future when I will be good at PHP )
