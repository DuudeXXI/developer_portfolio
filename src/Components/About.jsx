                    <p>Open minded person in need of knowledge in Web development. I see future there
                        and I want to be part of it with as much knowledge as I possibly can.<br></br><br></br>
                        I've finished <strong>Javascript</strong> with <strong>React.js</strong> courses at BIT.lt, I was one of the best students and I started with just a little knowledge in programming. From that point I understood that IT and especially - WorldWideWeb system is a thing I want to be involved in deeper.<br></br>So as I know basics and a little more about front-end I recently started learning back-end - PHP programming language and to me it gives another perspective about how WorldWideWeb actually works.<br></br><br></br>I'm open for work on long-term and short-term relationships.</p>
